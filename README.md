# React Native App Readme

This repository contains a React Native app built using Yarn as the package manager. This file provides information on how to run the app and execute tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the app or execute tests, please ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js (version 16 or above)
- Yarn

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

This command will install all the required packages listed in the package.json file.

## Running the App

To start the React Native app, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will launch the Metro bundler, which will compile your JavaScript code and start the development server. You can then open the app on a connected device or emulator.

By default, the app will be accessible via Expo on your local machine. You can follow the instructions in the terminal or console to open the app on an iOS or Android simulator, or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your physical device.

##Running Tests

To execute the tests for the React Native app, run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

This command will trigger the test runner and execute all the test cases defined in the __tests__ directory. The test results will be displayed in the console, indicating whether each test passed or failed.

Feel free to explore the package.json file to view and modify these scripts according to your project's needs.
